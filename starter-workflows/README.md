## GitHub Starter Workflows for Frogbot

This directory includes the code for Frogbot's Code Scanning GitHub templates.
Currently two templates are supported:

1. Frogbot Scan Pull Request - which allows editing and then adding the frogbot-scan-pr.yml workflow.
2. Frogbot Scan and Fix - which allows editing and then adding the forgbot-fix.yml workflow.

To start using Starter-Workflows, please refer to
the [Using starter workflows GitHub documentation.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/using-starter-workflows)

Whenever you make any changes to files in this directory, you should update them in the following repository as well, so
